#### I may be the most laziest and yet the most hard working person ever, the previous version of loop broke

#### for some reason the page won't load anymore

#### So instead of solving it and debugging it, I am gonna build a new one

#### better UI and features!

#### FYI this is the app to track movies, LOOP(Let's Officially Over Procrastinate)
