#### I may be the most laziest and yet the most hard working person ever, the previous version of loop broke

#### for some reason the page won't load anymore

#### So instead of solving it and debugging it, I am gonna build a new one

#### better UI and features!

#### FYI this is the app to track movies, LOOP(Let's Officially Over Procrastinate)
# To-do

* [x] Create the basic app
* [x] call the tmdb api(I am gonna generate random new theme everytime the page loads)
    * [x] Generate a Random image everytime the page loads
    * [x] Make that image the background of the first page
* [x] Create the form
* [ ] set up firebase and firestore
* [ ] work on each individual item(Movie Card)s

* [ ] Make it so we dont have to use videoURl, use the api used on Bmovies
* [ ] Add a checker to check if the movie is watched
* [x] Update the UI a bit (Dark Mode)
* [x] Get rid of Description
* [ ] Order movies with alphabet
* [ ] Modify twss counts 😉
